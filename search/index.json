There are some spoiler of the puzzle in this game. Please play the game first to avoid any spoiler.\nThis game is the entry for The Twentieth National Software Contest: NSC 2018. We have about 3 months to finish this project.\nWe manage to get the 2nd runner up in \u0026ldquo;Program for entertainment\u0026rdquo; .\nSince I mainly do a game system and some of the game design, I will cover these topics with in depth. However, I will leave the art aspect to the artist himself.\nWhy this game call \u0026ldquo;Doppelganger\u0026rdquo; If you already play the game, you will notice that there isn\u0026rsquo;t a single doppelganger in this game. We name this game \u0026ldquo;Doppelganger\u0026rdquo; at first because we want the game to do something about a clone of our player character.\nTurns out, none of the things we discuss in the early stage made it into the final product. Most of the things in the game come from a first month we made doing a rappid prototype and play testing a lot.\nBut this is the entry for the contest, We cannot change our name mid-way due to the proposal we sent during the first round of the competition. So we kinda have to live with that.\nTechnical Challenge Well, there are a lot of stuff I can cover.\nBut I will highlight the most challenge stuff here.\nIf you interested in the full postmortem, please read here.\nGame System The most challenge stuff to implement is the focus ability.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the world wrapping mechanic.\nLong story short.\nTo make this work, I need to test if player able to wrap themself back first.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say the overlap area is the testing area.\nAnd the blocker is an invinsible wall to prevent player from moving any further.\nIf the testing pass, blocker will let player wrapping themself.\nBut, if the testing fail, blocker will block player path.\nThis is roughly how it works in the game.\nCustom Editor I need to finish the game system and speed up our level works as well.\nMy custom sprite plotter and collision \u0026amp; collider plotter works perfectly.\nThe simple custom editor knowledge help making this possible.\nTo speed up plotting stuff, you just plot by making A and B point by clicking the mouse.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll form a rectangle, filling all the neccessary stuff inside it.\nTime Management As for the last 10 days, I adopt for the simple kanban board.\nThis help me focus on the task better.\nYou can see our board here .\nSummary I pour heart and souls into this project, really worth it at the end.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to check for the full postmortem here .\n","date":"2020-09-02","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/doppelganger/","tags":["Unity","NSC2018","Custom Editor"],"title":"Doppelganger"},{"content":"The first person shooting that heavy inspired by Lovely Planet.\nPlayer must defeat all enemies within the level to proceed to the next level.\ngame: https://github.com/CSaratakij/z3z/releases\nrespository: https://github.com/CSaratakij/z3z\nresponsible: all\nShowcase   Introduction Lovely Planet is amazing, But I want to add more level.\nSo, I try to clone it.\nTechnical Challenge The fact that player saw bullets travel from the gun barrel make things a little complicated.\nHit Register Since bullets need to move, I need to make sure the chance of collision tunneling is low.\nI need Continuous Collision Detection (CCD), using it with bullets.\nUnity provides collision detection type \u0026ldquo;Continuous Speculative\u0026rdquo;.\nWhich is the CCD but cheaper to calculate than the CCD with a sweep based.\nI also need to keep the bullet traveling with resonable low speed, further avoding the chance of tunneling.\nBullet Trajectory I need to make bullet appears at the gun barrel and travel with the aim direction.\nThe aim direction in the player perspective is from the center of the screen.\nThe gun itself need to look like it point to the center of the screen as well.\nSo, I need to rotate a gun to make it look like that some how.\nBecause there is no crosshair in this game, player should be able to aim from the hip by the line of sight that gun model create.\nWithout this line of sight, aiming is stupidly difficult.\nTo rotate the gun, I simply find a look direction of camera in world space, offset it forward and then make gun model look at that position (Rotate only Y-axis).\nSummary I already tweak the feels of player controlling.\nThe core functional works pretty well, need more level and enemy type (later).\nThis one is about trying to clone the game mechanic, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have an intention to release this to game site such as itch.io (aside from the source).\n","date":"2020-09-02","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/z3z/","tags":["Unity"],"title":"Z3z"},{"content":"The little project that demonstrate how to implement a path finding in the board game.\nrespository: https://github.com/CSaratakij/BoardGamePathFinding\nresponsible: all\nShowcase Demo   Custom Editor   Introduction My friend love Dokapon, he want to create his own spin for this game.\nSo, he ask me about the topic he need to research to make it possible.\nAfter I give him a list he need to study, the graph theory is the one I give him.\nSometime pass, he got stuck on how Dokapon path finding works.\n(Which need graph theory to better understand the issue. And yes, he do the homework)\nAfter pair programming done, I decide to implement my own just for fun.\nHow it works When playing Dokapon, player can see which destination they will reach after roll a dice.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the game need to know which path reach to the show destination.\nDokapon board is an undirected graph that have the same weight in every edges.\nThe problem here is not to find the shortest path.\nThe problem is actually, given N step to travel between node, which paths are availables?\nSince the graph has a loop in it, I need to turn it to tree first.\nThis is what I need to do to find the path.\n From some specific node, turn the graph to the tree by traverse to node in N step. Collect node to form the path along the way. After having a tree, traverse from leaf to root node and reverse its order to have a complete path.  Technical Challenge Ofcourse, path finding is challege to implement.\nI never play Dokapon, having friend to explain how player see the game work during playthough make problem easier.\nManually testing stuff to check if the algorithm is working or not is error prone and tire some.\nA bunch of unit test work great in this scenario.\nTo make this problem easier, I draw the graph and the step to solve this issue.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s me demonstrate.\nPath Finding Implementation Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the graph look like this.\nThe edges store by using adjacency list.\nAssume, player current node is at the \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; node.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s make \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; node the root of tree.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say, player roll result is 2.\nThen, it need to traverse 2 step from the \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;' node.\nUsing depth first search (DFS) to turn the graph to the tree.\nThe result look like this.\nTree depth represent the step of node traversal.\nAfter that, to get the path, we just need to traverse from the leaf node to the root.\nThen reverse its order.\nThe result store by dictionary (key pair), where key is the destination and value is the path.\n(Path can be more than one per destination)\nSometime, depends on the start node.\nThe path length will be less than the N step, That\u0026rsquo;s why some path from the tree need to remove.\nThe reason is simple.\nIf you roll the dice to get N step, you expect to move by N.\n(Not moving less than that)\nSummary Yeah, this is a little fun side project.\nWith a proper data structure, solving this become possible.\n","date":"2020-09-02","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/board-game-path-finding/","tags":["Unity","Custom Editor"],"title":"Board Game Path Finding"},{"content":"The game that inspired by the souls-like genre.\ngame: https://github.com/CSaratakij/Souls/releases\nrespository: https://github.com/CSaratakij/Souls\nother member:\nPattarawut Jarupramote (artist)\nresponsible: game system\nShowcase   Introduction This one start from the meme about the strong animal.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s weird\u0026hellip;.(I know)\nAt that time, I used to play souls-like game a lot.\nSo I thought, why not combine meme with souls-like genre?\nTechnical Challenge Animation This is a mix of root motion and non-root motion.\nThe hit confirm system is simple, is just estimate the hit area in front of the player, checking for any potential enemy and register hit when player doing the slash animation.\nThe headache come from adjusting the timing of animation to determine the time player can start hitting something by slash animation.\nCamera Surprisingly, I spend most of the time writing this.\nIf I realize sooner that the camera itself just orbiting player and look at the player all the time, things might speed up even further.\nThe challenge here is to make camera feels smooth as much as possible without obstruct by any obstacle (such as wall).\nSimply raycast from player to camera to check any obstacle and adjust camera position smoothly do the tricks.\nSummary Aside from not having an auto target lock system, it\u0026rsquo;s play okay for me.\nSure, the walking and combat need some fine tune.\nStill, not bad for a week of works.\n","date":"2021-01-07","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/souls/","tags":["Unity"],"title":"Souls"},{"content":"Transmit water to our lovely Potto.\nMake him growth even more bigger and stronger plant.\nThe entry for Global Game Jam 2018.\njam site: https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/potto-need-water\nresponsible: AI of Potto, UI Logic\nShowcase   Introduction This is my 3rd global game jam, Event is really fun.\nHaving two programmers make things easier, I focus on the AI of the Potto (flower pot).\nTechnical Challenge Coming up with an interesting AI behaviour in a shot time is challenge.\nAlthough, writing code itself is not an issue (Simple state machine get the job done).\nTrying to focus on coding via freezing cold is stupidly challenge.\n(Cause by jam site\u0026rsquo;s air conditioner..)\nJacket didn\u0026rsquo;t help me at all\u0026hellip;\nSummary Another fun jam.\nThe Potto AI is hilarious, exceed my own expection\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2020-09-02","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/potto-need-water/","tags":["Unity","Global Game Jam","GameJam"],"title":"Potto Need Water"},{"content":"The entry for Ludum Dare 41.\nGame that combine 2d hack and slash with a turn base strategy genre.\nOne player got a turn base game mechanic and another player got a hack and slash game mechanic.\nEach player must fight until their hit point reach to zero.\nOnly one player can play at a given turn.\ngame: https://csaratakij.itch.io/hack-turn\nrespository: https://github.com/CSaratakij/RTS_TBS\nother member:\nNattareeya Kositvasutha  (artist)\nresponsible: game system\nShowcase   Technical Challenge Well, the challenge is about implementing 2 game genre in the same game with limit time.\nI only have 72 hours to complete.\nThe one that play hack \u0026amp;

And refer \u0026quot;window\u0026quot; (without 's') as window of program (GUI).  Most of my workflow is on the linux side.\nTiling Window Manager with full (comfortable)keyboard control is one of the things I miss when using Windows.\nI get annoyed everytime I have to micro management window.\nFor example, move window around with mouse, click minimize/maximize window, etc..\nSo, I decide to hack things together to create my ideals desktop environment in just a week.\nMy ideals desktop environment consists of:\n Tiling window manager Bar (or taskbar) App Launcher  This is possible, thanks to Win32 API.\nAlthough, it has its own limit.\nTechnical Challenge Oh boys..where to begin..\nI\u0026rsquo;ll highlight just only the crucial stuff.\nBut first, I need to explain the terms.\nHWND is a window handle.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an int pointer, it can use to refer to window.\nDesktop and virtual desktops is not the same thing. (they call \u0026lsquo;virtual\u0026rsquo; for a reason)\nVirtual desktops is mimick multiple desktops without using the real multiple desktops.\nWorkspace is a group of window, virtual desktops and workspace is refer to the same thing.\nVirtual Desktop limitation Don't confuse this with Windows Virtual Desktop that run on Azure.  Since Windows 10, Virtual Desktops has been introduced.\nThe feature is great, but only a little COM api has been public.\nThe rest of virtual desktops api is hidden, undocument.\nSeriously, hidden to the point of being useless.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I can\u0026rsquo;t control how virtual desktops behave programmatically.\nI have to implement this stuff myself.\nThe simple array to hold HWND and making window minimize if the window is not belong to the current workspace do the tricks.\nHWND quirk The key to make this program works is to make sure HWND point to the same window at the time of this program collect window information.\nSuch as, when this program initialize, detect if some window get create/destroy, etc..\nUnfortunately, Windows decide to recycle HWND.\nSo, I cannot ensure the HWND that I get will point to the same window after initialize.\nOne thing for sure is, when window is hide (not show in the Task Switcher), HWND will get free.\nThat HWND becomes obsolete, ready to be recycle by Windows.\nI need to avoid hiding window.\nAlso, getting HWND by the window title name is not reliable.\nSome window will change its window title from time to time, for an example the Web Browser.\nWindow Filter The reason window need to be filter is simple.\nWin32 api provides the way to get all the window in the desktop, which is what I want.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;ll get all the window regardless of its visibility.\nFrom user perspective, visible window is the one user can see.\nAnd all user care about is the one that they can see.\nBut for some reason, the api that test if some window is really visible is not accurate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll report some hidden window back for me.\nI need to checks other information as well, like for example, window title information to be certain about its visibility.\nCustom Shell limitation To get the event message of every window in the desktop, I need to register shell hook.\nThe event message is the key to know whether or not some window will get create, destroy, maximize, minimize, etc\u0026hellip;\nThe default gui shell in Windows is Windows Explorer Shell.\nAt first, I want to replace the default shell.\nLike how cairo shell did.\nUnfortunately, there is no shell message available for custom shell.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s why this need to built on top of the Windows Explorer Shell.\nSummary With this functional implement, I can use Windows peacfully.\nAs long as Win32 API remain backward compatibility, it should works fine.\nThis is currently my first program to install and run when I need to use any computer with Windows on it.\n","date":"2020-09-02","permalink":"https://csaratakij.github.io/MyStuff/post/mywintiles/","tags":["C++","Win32api","Tiling Window Manager"],"title":"MyWinTiles"},{"content":"The custom taskbar design to use with MyWinTiles to properly show the current workspace.\nrelease: https://github.com/CSaratakij/MyWinBar/releases\nrepository: https://github.com/CSaratakij/MyWinBar\nresponsible: all\nShowcase   Introduction MyWinBar is the custom taskbar to be use with MyWinTiles.\nIt show information about workspaces, what window is currently on focus, battery status and current time.
